Abstract Classes and Methods
Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces .

The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:

Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from
 another class).

Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by
the subclass (inherited from).
An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:

Why And When To Use Abstract Classes and Methods?
To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object.

Points to Remember
An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It cannot be instantiated.
It can have constructors and static methods also.
It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
