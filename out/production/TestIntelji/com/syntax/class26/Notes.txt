Abstraction in Java
Hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality only.Two methods to achieve abstractions
1.Abstract classess
2.Interfaces
Abstract classess:
Abstract classes are class with abstract keyword
Interfaces: interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword
to achieve multiple inheritance we need interface
How to decide which one to use:
1. Prefer the interfaces over abstract classes
2.if two or more classes are closely related to each other go with abstract classes for example if we have to create a
lion class and a horse class we should go with abstract classes and should create an animal abstract class.if two classes
are not related to each other for example an apple and a cloth class we should create an interface for that like if we
 want to have a behaviour WashAble interface, we can implement this method both class.

 Encapsulation: data hiding by making variables private and providing public getter and setter methods
 It is  the fourth pillar of OOPS it provides security and better control over the data of a class.we create classes
 and inside those classes we create private fields and methods. These methods are classes "getter setter methods:" and we
 set and get the values of the class field with the help of these methods instead of accessing
