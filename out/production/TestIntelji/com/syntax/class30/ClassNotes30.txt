MAP :
is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs
Benefits of Maps are;
1.we can store two values inside the maps
2.searching is very efficient in maps

Types of Maps;
there are so many types Maps but mostly used maps are; HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap

HashMap:
insertion order is not maintained( downside).
insertion and retrieval  is the fastest (upside)

LinkedHashMap
insertion order is maintained
insertion speed is same with HashMap but retrieval speed is slowest in all the maps

TreeMaps:
Data is sorted in natural order by default
Insertion speed is the slowest but retrieval speed is better than LinkedHashMap but slower than HashMap

Map is not belong to Collection framework!!! thats why we can not do convertion. set can store only one single value
Maps can store many value

Rules:
We can not convert a collection to a map for example we can not convert a set to a Map
Map<String, String> students=new Map<>()
students.put("yaz123", "Yazgul");
Set<String> set=new HashSet(students)



DifferencebetweenSet,ListandMapinJava?
• Set, List and Map are 3 important interface of Java collection framework.
 o List provides ordered and indexed collection which may contain duplication .
 o Set provides un-ordered collection of unique objects. Set doesn’t allowed duplication . List and Set are both extend
collection interface.
 o Map provides a data structure based on Key Value. Key is always unique, value can be dupl.
