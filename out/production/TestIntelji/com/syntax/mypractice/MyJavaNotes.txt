The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.
It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses and subclasses
 that have methods with the same name.To understand the super keyword, you should have a basic understanding of
 Inheritance and Polymorphism.The super keyword also used to access the method of parent class when child class has
 overridden that method.
 ==super() is used to call super class constructor from subclass  constructor.
 ==super is used to call super class variables and methods by the subclass object when they are overridden by  subclass.
== this is used to refer current-class instance as well as static members
 ==super is used to refer super-classâ€™s instance as well as static members.
 NOTE: We can use this as well as super  anywhere except static area.
