Set in Java
set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes for example
Set interfaces are; HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet
class can interfaces many interfacesses

Properties of Set:
=All the Sets do not allow duplicates

HashSet:
1.HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
2.it is the fastest in all Sets. thats why it is most widely used Set

LinkedHashSet:
1.maintains the insertion order
2.slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions

TreeSet:
1.Sorts the data in natural order for number in increasing order
2.it is slowest when it comes to store the data

When to use which type of Set:
==if we do not care about  insertion order  and data being sorted always we can use HashSet!
==if we need the insertion order we do not have much choice we have to use the LinkedHashSet
==if we do not care about the insertion order we can compare it with TreeSet

LinkedHashSet                    vs                         TreeSet
=Insertion is not slow                                    = The Slowest insertion
=Retrival is super slow                                   =retrival is slower than HashSet but faster than LinkedHasset

Interview Question????

I do not care about insertion order but i can about retrieval speed which Set should I use? (HashSet )
I do care about insertion order but i do not care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?(LinkedSet)
if I want to have sorted data all the  time? (TreeSet)
