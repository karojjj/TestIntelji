Inheritance in Java: It is a mechanism in java through which a child calls get the properties and methods from a parent class.
mechanism which acquires all properties and behavior or methods of parent class
Benefits of inheritances:
=saves times to code
=code duplication is reduced
=execution time is faster
Disadvantages :classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class
Types of inheritance: there are 4 types but Java supports 3 of them
1.Single inheritance:
we have only one child and one parent class or only two classes participate inheritance one as child one as parent.
child class=derive class=subclass
a child class has a single direct parent .
class Parent{
}
class Child extends Parent{
}
2.Multilevel  inheritance
When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance. We have multiple levels of inheritance for
example if we have classes A B C class C will be inherited from B and b will be inherited from C.
class A{
}
class B extends A{
}
class C extends B{
}
3.Hierarchical inheritance
In Hierarchical inheritance we have a single parent and multiple child classes.
class Parent{
}
class Child1 extends Parent{
}
class Child2 extends Parents{
}
4. Multiple(not supported in java) inheritance
Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?
To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes.
The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object,
 there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.

 SUPER KEYWORD: is like the "this" it refers to the parent class object for example we can access the fields method or
 constructors of parent class inside the child class using this keyword
 briefly The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.
 Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly
 which is referred by super reference variable.
